# Requirements Engineering - Assignment 1 & 2 Guidelines

## Objective

Assignment 1 and 2 are closely related to each other. In these two assignments, you will analyse the requirements and write a requirements specification for a software development project of your own choice from the problem statements provided. Assignment 1 expects you to model the problem using a mixture of modelling techniques.

## Doing the Assignment 1

Your group may use requirement elicitation techniques for information-gathering (e.g. interviews) to collect any additional information you need to refine the requirements provided in the problem statement.

### Tasks

1. **Identify the system stakeholders**

2. **Identify all the functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR), constraints**

3. **Develop Strategic Dependency (SD) diagram** to model the strategic dependencies between the key stakeholders/actors and capture the organisational context

4. **Develop a high-level Business Model** using Business Model Canvas

5. **Develop a UML Use Case Diagram** to model the high-level behaviour of system and provide 5 or 6 scenarios

6. **Implement the Agile/Scrum planning and estimation** to your project:
   - Develop a Product backlog table: user stories, story points, and sprint number
   - Assign a point value to each task based on its complexity
   - Assign a sprint/iteration number to each task (For example, if you have 4 weeks to submit the assignment, you can consider 4 sprints to complete it with each sprint lasting 7 days)
   - Design a burn-down/burn-up chart and provide an explanation (Note: you can use Excel to design the table and burn-up chart)
   - Develop a requirements traceability matrix (RTM)

## Written Requirements

Your group must submit **ONE report in PDF format** (containing all relevant graphics) that should contain the following:

| Items | More Details |
|-------|--------------|
| **Cover Page** | All group members names, student IDs, project title |
| **Introduction** | 1 page description about the project domain, organization, existing problems etc. |
| **Description** | 1–2-page description of the requirements elicitation techniques used for the elicitation |
| **List of stakeholders** | List down all stakeholders |
| **Business Model Canvas** | Business model using the BM canvas |
| **Strategic Dependency model** | High level SD model showing the dependencies between actors/stakeholders |
| **Functional and Non-functional requirements, constraints** | Produce a list of FR and NFR using the templates and guidelines given during the lectures |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | For at least 4 of the functional requirements |
| **UML Use Case diagram, 5 or 6 scenarios** | Draw a use case diagram including actors, use cases and relationships. Each member should write a scenario for a use case |
| **Product Backlog table** | With user stories, estimations (story points) and sprint number |
| **Burn-down/burn-up chart** | Develop a BD chart with an explanation |
| **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** | A Table mapping each stakeholder to requirements, user stories, tasks, test cases etc. |
| **References List** | Provide all references to all resources and tools used |
| **Group members contribution table** | 1 page table indicating which members developed which item with page numbers |

## Important Notes

- **Drawings must be clear and legible.** You can use open-source/free modelling tools of your choice like ArgoUML, Star UML, PlantUML etc to draw your models

- **Clearly list any assumptions** you might make in completing this assignment at appropriate places

- **Make sure you provide enough commentary** (and annotations) with the models for the reader to understand what each model is of, and how to understand them

- **Provide any further appendices** you feel are relevant

- **Text font size should be 11 points**
