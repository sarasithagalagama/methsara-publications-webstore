## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Domain

Methsara Publications is an established educational publishing company in Sri Lanka that specialises in producing high-quality study materials for students in grades 6–13. The company currently operates through three physical locations: Main Branch (headquarters), Balangoda Branch, and Kottawa Branch. Their product catalogue includes textbooks, revision guides, past papers, and exam preparation materials aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum (O/L, A/L, Scholarship).

### 1.2 Organisation Background

The organisation has been serving the educational community for several years, building a strong reputation among students, parents, and teachers. However, their current business model relies heavily on traditional brick-and-mortar operations, limiting market reach and operational efficiency.

### 1.3 Existing Problems

**Operational Challenges:**
- **Manual Inventory Management:** Stock tracking across three branches is done manually, leading to frequent discrepancies and inefficient stock transfers
- **Limited Market Reach:** Physical storefront operations restrict customer access to business hours and geographical proximity
- **Procurement Inefficiencies:** Manual purchase order processes create coordination challenges with suppliers and delays in restocking
- **No Real-time Visibility:** Store owners and managers lack real-time insights into stock levels, sales performance, and financial metrics
- **Customer Inconvenience:** Students and parents cannot browse or purchase materials outside business hours or from remote locations

### 1.4 Proposed Solution

The Methsara Publications Webstore is a comprehensive e-commerce platform (MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) designed to digitally transform the business operations. The system provides 24/7 online access for customers, unified multi-location inventory management, automated procurement workflows, and data-driven business insights organised into six core Epics:

| Epic | Domain |
|------|--------|
| E1 | User & Role Management |
| E2 | Product Catalogue Management |
| E3 | Order & Transaction Management |
| E4 | Supplier Management |
| E5 | Inventory Management |
| E6 | Promotion & Loyalty Management |

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Requirements Identification and Elicitation

Our team employed multiple requirements engineering techniques:

**Stakeholder Interviews** — Structured interviews with the business owner, inventory managers, customers (students, parents, teachers), and finance personnel revealed critical needs including multi-location inventory visibility, multiple payment options (COD and bank transfer), role-based access control, and automated stock alerts.

**Document Analysis** — Review of manual inventory ledgers, sample purchase orders, supplier invoices, customer receipts, and existing product catalogues provided insights into existing workflows and data structures.

**Observation** — Direct observation of customer purchasing behaviour, inventory counting, stock transfer processes, and order processing revealed peak demand patterns and operational bottlenecks.

**Workshops & Brainstorming** — Team sessions with the business owner and operational staff produced the six-epic breakdown, user role definitions, and feature prioritisation.

### 2.2 Requirements Documentation

Requirements were documented using:
- IEEE 830-compatible structured tables (ID, description, priority, stakeholder)
- Use case scenarios with main and alternative flows
- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin-style Given/When/Then format
- User stories with MoSCoW prioritisation in the product backlog

### 2.3 Discussion — Difficulties, Limitations, and Lessons Learned

**Difficulties Encountered:**
- Distinguishing between what stakeholders *want* vs. what is technically *feasible* within the project timeline
- Capturing non-functional requirements at a measurable level (e.g., defining specific response time thresholds required research into benchmarks)
- Modelling complex multi-location inventory flows where the same product exists at three different locations simultaneously

**Limitations:**
- Analysis was based on a hypothetical client scenario; actual stakeholder interviews were simulated through document analysis and domain research
- The scope was limited to web-based access; mobile applications were deliberately excluded from Phase 1

**Lessons Learned:**
- Early stakeholder involvement prevents costly requirement changes later
- UML modelling reveals gaps and ambiguities in textual requirements that are not immediately obvious
- Separating structural, behavioural, and flow models provides complementary perspectives on the same system
- Decision tables and trees are powerful tools for capturing complex conditional business logic clearly

## 3. Refined List of Functional Requirements (FR)

> Requirements are refined and verified against the implemented MERN codebase.

### FR1: User & Admin Management

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Stakeholder | Implementation Note |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| FR1.1 | The system shall allow customers to self-register with name, email, password, and phone. The account shall be immediately activated and a JWT issued for direct login. | High | Students, Parents, Teachers | **[UPDATED]** — Email verification removed; `isEmailVerified` defaults to `true`. Email verification is a Phase 2 feature. |
| FR1.2 | The system shall provide secure login with JWT session management. Deactivated accounts shall be blocked from login. | High | All Users | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.3 | The system shall allow customers to manage their profiles (name, delivery addresses, phone). | High | Students, Parents, Teachers | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.4 | The system shall allow System Administrators to create staff accounts with assigned roles (admin, product_manager, finance_manager, supplier_manager, master_inventory_manager, location_inventory_manager, marketing_manager). | High | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.5 | The system shall allow System Administrators to assign staff members to specific branch locations. | High | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.6 | The system shall enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — all API endpoints protected by JWT middleware that validates role and permissions. | High | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.7 | The system shall provide a password reset mechanism: the user submits their email, a 6-digit SHA-256 hashed token with 1-hour expiry is generated, and the user submits the token with a new password to complete the reset. | Medium | All Users | **[UPDATED]** — Token returned in API response (not emailed). Email-based delivery is a Phase 2 feature. |
| FR1.8 | The system shall force staff to change their password on first login. The `mustChangePassword` flag is set to `true` on account creation and cleared after the first password change. | Medium | Staff Members | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.9 | The system shall allow System Administrators to view, search, and filter all user accounts (customers and staff). | Medium | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.10 | The system shall allow System Administrators to deactivate user accounts. Administrators cannot deactivate their own account. | Medium | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.11 | The system shall maintain security audit logs: login history and session records (IP address, device, browser, login timestamp). | Low | System Administrator | Implemented ✓ — `Session` collection with UA-Parser device detection. |
| FR1.12 | The system shall allow customers to manage multiple saved delivery addresses. | Medium | Students, Parents, Teachers | Implemented ✓ |
| FR1.13 | The system shall allow authenticated users to view active sessions (device, browser, IP) and revoke individual sessions remotely. | Medium | All Users | **[NEW]** — Identified and implemented during development. |

> **Assumption on Email Services:** Email-based verification and password reset token delivery via email are deferred to Phase 2 due to SMTP infrastructure constraints. All other security properties (bcrypt hashing, JWT, RBAC, session tracking) are fully implemented in Phase 1.

```

**Commentary:** The system is deployed on a cloud server with two server ports: port 3000 for the React frontend (Vite) and port 5000 for the Node.js/Express REST API. MongoDB Atlas provides the cloud-hosted NoSQL database, accessed via Mongoose ODM. A local `uploads/` directory stores product images and bank transfer proof files. External SMTP is used for customer emails, password resets, and sending purchase orders to suppliers.

note over Admin, DB
  Staff member receives credentials separately.
  On first login, mustChangePassword = true

end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This diagram illustrates FR1.4 — the admin's ability to create role-specific staff accounts. The flow demonstrates two key security layers: the JWT middleware validates the admin's token, and the RBAC check ensures only `admin`-role users can reach this endpoint. Server-side validation checks email format, phone (10 digits), NIC format, and age (≥ 18 years). The `mustChangePassword: true` flag ensures the staff member sets their own password on first login (FR1.8).

### 7.2 UML Sequence Diagram — Use Case 2: Place Order with COD & Coupon

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceArrowThickness 1.5
actor Customer
participant "React Frontend" as FE
participant "Checkout API\n/api/orders" as API
participant "Coupon Model" as Coupon
participant "Inventory Model" as Inv
participant "Order Model" as Order
participant "Email Service" as Email

Customer -> FE: Click "Proceed to Checkout"
FE -> FE: Display checkout form
Customer -> FE: Select address, COD, enter coupon "EXAM2024"
FE -> API: POST /api/coupons/validate\n{code: "EXAM2024", total: 2450}
API -> Coupon: Find coupon by code
Coupon --> API: Coupon found
API -> Coupon: Validate (active, date, minPurchase, usage limit)
Coupon --> API: Valid ✓
API --> FE: {valid: true, discount: 245}
FE --> Customer: Shows updated total: Rs. 2,505

Customer -> FE: Click "Place Order"
FE -> API: POST /api/orders\n{items, address, payment: COD, coupon, total}
API -> Inv: Check stock availability per item
Inv --> API: Stock sufficient ✓
API -> Order: Create order document
Order --> API: {orderId: #MP-2024-00123, status: "Pending"}
API -> Inv: Deduct stock (atomic transaction)
Inv --> API: Stock deducted ✓
API -> Coupon: Increment usageCount, log usage
API -> Email: Send confirmation email to customer
API --> FE: 201 Created {orderId, message}
FE --> Customer: ✅ "Order placed! #MP-2024-00123"

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This sequence shows the atomicity of order placement: stock deduction and order creation succeed or fail together. Coupon validation is a separate pre-check. The system prevents overselling by checking real-time inventory before confirming.

### 7.3 UML Sequence Diagram — Use Case 3: Inter-Branch Stock Transfer

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceArrowThickness 1.5
actor "Balangoda\nInventory Manager" as Mgr1
actor "Main Branch\nInventory Manager" as Mgr2
participant "React Frontend" as FE
participant "Transfer API\n/api/stock-transfers" as API
participant "Inventory Model" as Inv
participant "Notification Service" as Notif

Mgr1 -> FE: Navigate to Stock Levels
FE -> API: GET /api/inventory/location/balangoda
API --> FE: Stock list (Grade 11 Science: 3 units ⚠️)
FE --> Mgr1: Low-stock alert shown

Mgr1 -> FE: Click "Request Transfer"\n{product, qty:20, from: Main, to: Balangoda}
FE -> API: POST /api/stock-transfers/request\n{productId, qty, fromLocation, reason}
API -> Inv: Check fromLocation stock (Main: 65 units)
Inv --> API: Sufficient stock ✓
API -> API: Create TransferRequest\n{status: "Pending", transferId: #TR-2024-00045}
API -> Notif: Notify Main Branch Manager
API --> FE: {transferId, status: "Pending"}
FE --> Mgr1: ✅ Transfer requested

Mgr2 -> FE: Open transfer request #TR-2024-00045
FE -> API: GET /api/stock-transfers/:id
API --> FE: Transfer details
Mgr2 -> FE: Click "Approve Transfer"
FE -> API: PUT /api/stock-transfers/:id/approve
API -> Inv: Deduct 20 from Main (65→45)
API -> Inv: Add 20 to Balangoda (3→23)
API -> API: Update transfer status → "Approved"
API -> Notif: Notify Balangoda Manager
API --> FE: {status: "Approved"}
FE --> Mgr2: ✅ "Transfer approved. Stock updated."

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This diagram shows the request-approval workflow for inter-branch transfers. The stock modification happens only after approval, and both managers are notified. The system prevents negative stock at the source location.

### 7.4 UML Sequence Diagram — Use Case 4: Create Purchase Order & Receive Stock

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceArrowThickness 1.5
actor "Supplier Manager" as SM
actor "Inventory Manager" as IM
participant "React Frontend" as FE
participant "PO API\n/api/purchase-orders" as API
participant "PurchaseOrder Model" as PO
participant "Inventory Model" as Inv
participant "Email Service" as Email

SM -> FE: Navigate to Purchase Orders → Create New PO
SM -> FE: Select supplier, add items, set delivery date
FE -> API: POST /api/purchase-orders\n{supplierId, items, location, deliveryDate}
API -> PO: Create PO {poNumber: PO-2024-00078, status: "Draft"}
PO --> API: PO created
API --> FE: {poId, status: "Draft"}
FE --> SM: ✅ PO created in Draft

SM -> FE: Review PO → Click "Send to Supplier"
FE -> API: PUT /api/purchase-orders/:id/send
API -> PO: Update status → "Sent"
API -> Email: Email PO PDF to supplier
Email --> SM: Supplier notified
API --> FE: {status: "Sent"}
FE --> SM: ✅ PO sent to supplier

note over SM, IM: [Two weeks later — supplier delivers stock]

IM -> FE: Navigate to Receive Stock → Select PO-2024-00078
FE -> API: GET /api/purchase-orders/:id
API --> FE: PO details (expected items)
IM -> FE: Verify quantities → Click "Confirm Receipt"
FE -> API: PUT /api/purchase-orders/:id/receive\n{actualQuantities}
API -> PO: Update status → "Received"
API -> Inv: Add received stock to Main Branch inventory
Inv --> API: Stock updated ✓
API -> Email: Notify Finance Manager (invoice due)
API --> FE: {status: "Received", inventoryUpdated: true}
FE --> IM: ✅ "Stock received and inventory updated."

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This diagram shows the full purchase order lifecycle from draft creation through supplier notification to stock receipt. When the inventory manager confirms receipt, stock is automatically added to the designated branch inventory, and the Finance Manager is notified to process the supplier invoice.

### 7.5 UML Sequence Diagram — Use Case 5: Product Search & Filtering

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceArrowThickness 1.5
actor Customer
participant "React Frontend" as FE
participant "Product API\n/api/products" as API
participant "Product Model\n(MongoDB)" as DB

Customer -> FE: Navigate to Storefront
FE -> API: GET /api/products
API -> DB: Query all active products
DB --> API: Product list (all)
API --> FE: 200 OK {products[]}
FE --> Customer: Display product grid

Customer -> FE: Enter search term: "Mathematics"
FE -> API: GET /api/products?search=Mathematics
API -> DB: Text search on title, author, isbn
DB --> API: Matching products (47 results)
API --> FE: {products[], count: 47}
FE --> Customer: Display 47 matching results (highlighted)

Customer -> FE: Apply filter: Grade=10, Subject=Mathematics
FE -> API: GET /api/products?grade=Grade10&subject=Mathematics
API -> DB: Query with grade & subject filters
DB --> API: Filtered products (12 results)
API --> FE: {products[], count: 12}
FE --> Customer: Display 12 filtered results

Customer -> FE: Sort by "Price: Low to High"
FE -> API: GET /api/products?sort=price_asc
API -> DB: Apply sort on price field
DB --> API: Sorted products
API --> FE: {products[] sorted}
FE --> Customer: Reorder product grid

Customer -> FE: Click on "Grade 10 Maths Revision Guide"
FE -> API: GET /api/products/:id
API -> DB: Find product by ID
DB --> API: Full product document
API -> DB: GET /api/reviews?product=:id
DB --> API: Reviews list (4.5 stars, 23 reviews)
API --> FE: {product, reviews}
FE --> Customer: Display product detail page\n(images, price, stock status, reviews)

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This sequence shows product discovery as a series of progressive refinements. The first request loads the full catalogue; each subsequent call applies additional query parameters (`search`, `grade`, `subject`, `sort`) to narrow results. Selecting a product triggers two parallel data fetches — product details and its associated reviews — which are combined before display.

### 7.6 UML Sequence Diagram — Use Case 6: Create & Apply Discount Coupon

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceArrowThickness 1.5
actor "Marketing Manager" as MM
actor Customer
participant "React Frontend" as FE
participant "Coupon API\n/api/coupons" as API
participant "Coupon Model" as CouponDB
participant "Order Model" as OrderDB

== Part 1: Coupon Creation ==
MM -> FE: Navigate to Promotions → Create Coupon
MM -> FE: Fill coupon form\n{code: EXAM2024, discount: 10%, minPurchase: 2000,\nvalidFrom: 2024-03-01, validUntil: 2024-03-31,\nmaxUsage: 500, perUser: 1}
FE -> API: POST /api/coupons {couponData}
API -> CouponDB: Check code uniqueness
CouponDB --> API: Code is unique ✓
API -> CouponDB: Create Coupon {isActive: true}
CouponDB --> API: Coupon created
API --> FE: 201 Created {couponId, code: EXAM2024}
FE --> MM: ✅ "Coupon EXAM2024 created successfully!"

== Part 2: Customer Applies Coupon at Checkout ==
Customer -> FE: Enter coupon code "EXAM2024" at checkout
FE -> API: POST /api/coupons/validate {code, cartTotal: 2450, userId}
API -> CouponDB: Find coupon by code
CouponDB --> API: Coupon found
API -> CouponDB: Run validation checks\n(active ✓, date ✓, minPurchase ✓, usageLimit 45/500 ✓, perUser ✓)
CouponDB --> API: All checks passed
API --> FE: {valid: true, discountAmount: 245, finalTotal: 2505}
FE --> Customer: Shows discount applied → Total Rs. 2,505

Customer -> FE: Click "Place Order"
FE -> API: POST /api/orders {items, couponCode: EXAM2024, total: 2505}
API -> OrderDB: Create Order with couponDiscount=245
OrderDB --> API: Order created
API -> CouponDB: Increment currentUsageCount (45→46)\nLog usage: {userId, orderId, discountApplied, usedAt}
CouponDB --> API: Usage recorded
API --> FE: 201 Created {orderId, total: 2505}
FE --> Customer: ✅ Order confirmed with discount applied

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This sequence covers the complete coupon lifecycle in two phases: creation by the Marketing Manager and redemption by a customer at checkout. The validation call is a separate pre-check (non-destructive); the usage count is only incremented upon successful order placement, preventing wasted quota from abandoned checkouts.

### 7.7 UML State Diagram — Order Object

The following state diagram shows all possible states of an `Order` object throughout its lifecycle.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Pending : Customer places order\n(POST /api/orders)

Pending --> Processing : Admin confirms order\n& verifies payment
Pending --> Cancelled : Customer cancels\nor payment fails

Processing --> Shipped : Admin marks\nas dispatched
Processing --> Cancelled : Admin cancels\n(refund triggered)

Shipped --> Delivered : Delivery confirmed\nby admin/customer
Shipped --> Returned : Customer reports\nnon-delivery

Delivered --> Refunded : Finance Manager\nprocesses refund

Cancelled --> [*] : Order closed\n(stock restored)
Returned --> Refunded : Refund approved
Refunded --> [*] : Order archived

Delivered --> [*] : Order complete\n(archived after 7 years)

note right of Pending
  Stock reserved but not
  permanently deducted
  until Processing
end note

note right of Cancelled
  On cancel: stock is
  restored to inventory
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The Order state machine shows seven valid states. Cancellation is allowed from `Pending` and `Processing` states, restoring stock to inventory each time. Once `Delivered`, the order is complete unless a refund is requested. `Returned` is an exception flow that routes into the `Refunded` terminal state.

---

### 7.8 UML State Diagram — PurchaseOrder Object

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Draft : Supplier Manager creates PO\n(POST /api/purchase-orders)

Draft --> Sent : Supplier Manager\nsubmits PO to supplier\n(PUT /api/purchase-orders/:id/send)
Draft --> Cancelled : Supplier Manager\ndiscards draft

Sent --> Confirmed : Supplier confirms\nacceptance of PO
Sent --> Cancelled : Supplier rejects\nor no response

Confirmed --> Received : Inventory Manager\nconfirms full delivery\n(PUT /api/purchase-orders/:id/receive)
Confirmed --> Cancelled : Supplier cancels\nafter confirmation

Received --> [*] : PO complete\n(inventory levels updated)
Cancelled --> [*] : PO closed\n(no stock transferred)

note right of Received
  On Received: inventory.quantity
  is incremented at target branch
  for all received items
end note

note right of Draft
  poNumber auto-generated
  as PO-YYYY-NNNNN
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The `PurchaseOrder` object moves through five states (Draft, Sent, Confirmed, Received, Cancelled). The `Received` terminal state triggers automatic inventory updates at the target branch location. Cancellation is permitted from any non-terminal state, allowing flexibility for supplier negotiations or order errors.

---

### 7.9 UML State Diagram — StockTransfer Object

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Pending : Location Manager submits\ntransfer request\n(POST /api/stock-transfers/request)

Pending --> Approved : Approving Manager\naccepts the request\n(PUT /api/stock-transfers/:id/approve)
Pending --> Rejected : Approving Manager\ndeclines request\n(PUT /api/stock-transfers/:id/reject)

Approved --> Completed : Stock physically\ntransferred and confirmed
Rejected --> [*] : Transfer closed\n(no stock movement)
Completed --> [*] : Transfer archived\n(both inventories updated)

note right of Approved
  On Approve:
  - Source branch quantity decremented
  - Destination branch quantity incremented
  (atomic operation)
end note

note right of Rejected
  Rejection reason stored
  and notified to requesting
  manager
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The `StockTransfer` state machine enforces a request-approval workflow. The actual stock movement (atomic increment/decrement of inventory at source and destination branches) only occurs on the `Approved` transition, preventing premature or unauthorised stock changes. Both the approved and completed states allow audit trail reconstruction.

---

### 7.10 UML State Diagram — User Account Object

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Active : Account created\n(register or createStaff)

Active --> MustChangePassword : Staff account created\n(mustChangePassword = true)
MustChangePassword --> Active : Staff changes password\n(PUT /api/auth/change-password)

Active --> Deactivated : Admin deactivates account\n(PUT /api/auth/deactivate/:id)
Deactivated --> Active : Admin reactivates account

Active --> PasswordResetPending : User requests\npassword reset\n(POST /api/auth/forgot-password)
PasswordResetPending --> Active : Reset token used\nsuccessfully within 1 hour\n(POST /api/auth/reset-password)
PasswordResetPending --> Active : Token expires\n(no action — account stays active)

Deactivated --> [*] : Account permanently\ndeleted (admin action)
Active --> [*] : Account deleted

note right of Deactivated
  isActive = false
  Login blocked even with
  correct password
end note

note right of MustChangePassword
  mustChangePassword = true
  is set for all newly created
  staff accounts (FR1.8)
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The `User` account object has multiple concurrent sub-states. A staff user enters the `MustChangePassword` sub-state immediately on creation, which must be resolved before full access is granted. Deactivation blocks login without deleting data, supporting account recovery. The `PasswordResetPending` state is transient — the token expires after 1 hour and the account automatically reverts to `Active` without any change.

---

### 7.11 UML State Diagram — Coupon Object

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Active : Marketing Manager creates coupon\n(POST /api/coupons)\nisActive = true

Active --> Exhausted : currentUsageCount\nreaches maxUsageCount
Active --> Expired : Current date exceeds\nvalidUntil date
Active --> Deactivated : Marketing Manager\nmanually deactivates\n(PUT /api/coupons/:id)

Exhausted --> [*] : Coupon archived\n(no further redemption possible)
Expired --> [*] : Coupon archived
Deactivated --> Active : Marketing Manager\nreactivates coupon

note right of Active
  Validation checks at checkout:
  1. Code exists
  2. isActive = true
  3. validFrom ≤ today ≤ validUntil
  4. cartTotal ≥ minPurchaseAmount
  5. currentUsageCount < maxUsageCount
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The `Coupon` object enters three possible terminal-like states depending on how it becomes invalid: exhaustion (usage limit reached), expiry (date passed), or manual deactivation by the Marketing Manager. Only `Deactivated` is recoverable — the Marketing Manager can reactivate a coupon. `Exhausted` and `Expired` states are permanent. All five checkout validation checks must pass for a coupon in `Active` state to be applied (FR6.6).

---

### 7.12 UML State Diagram — Product Object

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam state {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}

[*] --> Active : Product Manager creates product\n(POST /api/products)\nisActive = true

Active --> Archived : Product Manager archives product\n(visibility toggle — isActive = false)\n(PUT /api/products/:id/archive)
Archived --> Active : Product Manager restores product

Active --> FeaturedActive : Product Manager\nenables featured flag\n(isFeatured = true)
FeaturedActive --> Active : Featured flag removed

Active --> FlashSaleActive : Product Manager\nenables flash sale\n(isFlashSale = true)
FlashSaleActive --> Active : Flash sale ends

Active --> [*] : Product permanently deleted\n(only if stock = 0 across all locations)
Archived --> [*] : Product permanently deleted

note right of Archived
  Archived products:
  - Hidden from storefront
  - Still visible to managers
  - Can be restored at any time
  - Stock NOT affected by archive
end note

note right of FeaturedActive
  Featured and FlashSale
  flags are independent —
  a product can be both
  simultaneously
end note

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The `Product` state machine separates visibility from deletion. `Archived` is a soft-delete — the product is hidden from the storefront but retained in the database with its inventory intact (per the codebase refactoring from a previous session). Permanent deletion is restricted to products with zero stock across all locations. The `FeaturedActive` and `FlashSaleActive` are orthogonal sub-states that can be combined independently.

## 8. Flow Models

### 8.1 UML Activity Diagram — Use Case 1: Admin Creates a Staff Account (FR1.4)

endif

|MongoDB|

if (Email already exists?) then (yes)
  :Return 409 Conflict\n"Email already registered";
  stop

endif

|Express API|
:User.create({\n  name, email, phone, role,\n  userType: "staff",\n  assignedLocation,\n  mustChangePassword: true,\n  isActive: true,\n  isEmailVerified: true\n});

|MongoDB|
:Save new staff User document;
:Return { _id, name, email, role, assignedLocation };

|Express API|
:Return 201 Created\n{ message, user: {id, name, email, role} };

|React Frontend|
:Display success toast\n"Staff account created successfully";
:Refresh Staff Management table;

|System Administrator|
:New staff member visible in table;
stop

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This swimlane activity diagram for FR1.4 clearly separates responsibilities across five lanes. The System Administrator owns the form interaction. The React Frontend handles client-side validation. The Auth Middleware performs the JWT verification and RBAC check before any business logic runs. The Express API executes server-side validation and constructs the user document. MongoDB persists the record. The `mustChangePassword: true` flag enforces FR1.8 on the staff member's first login.

### 8.2 UML Activity Diagram — Use Case 2: Place Order (FR3.1–FR3.12)

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam activity {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}
skinparam partition {
  BorderColor #336699
  FontStyle bold
}

|Customer|

  |Express API|
  :Run 5-step coupon validation\n(exists → active → dates →\nminPurchase → usageLimit);
  if (Coupon valid?) then (yes)
    :Return discounted total;
    |React Frontend|
    :Display updated total with discount;
  else (no)
    :Return error message;
    |React Frontend|
    :Show coupon error to customer;

|Express API|
:Validate stock availability\nfor all ordered items;

|MongoDB|
:Check inventory.available\nfor each product at branch;
if (All items in stock?) then (no)
  |Express API|
  :Return 400: "Item no longer in stock";
  |Customer|
  :View error message;
  stop
else (yes)
endif

|Express API|
:Create Order record\n{status: Pending, paymentStatus: Pending};
:Atomically deduct stock\nfrom fulfillment location;
if (Coupon used?) then (yes)
  :Increment coupon usageCount;
  :Log coupon usage history;
else (no)
endif

|MongoDB|
:Save Order, update Inventory;

|Express API|
if (Payment = Bank Transfer?) then (yes)
  :Return 201 with upload prompt;
  |Customer|
  :Upload bank transfer slip image;
  |Express API|
  :Save slip path {paymentStatus: Pending};
else (COD)
  :Return 201 Created\n{orderId, status: Pending};
endif

|React Frontend|
:Display Order confirmation page\n(Order ID, items, total, ETA);

|Customer|
:Receive order confirmation;
stop

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** This swimlane diagram separates the four active participants in order placement. The Customer drives the interaction. The React Frontend handles UI state, parallel data loads (addresses + subtotal), and form submission. The Express API runs all business rules (stock check, coupon validation, atomic stock deduction). MongoDB stores the final Order and updates Inventory. The bank transfer upload is an asynchronous branch specific to that payment method.

endif

```

**Commentary:** The stock transfer swimlane diagram clearly separates the two inventory manager roles — the Requesting Manager initiates the process while the Approving Manager has decision authority. The atomic fork in MongoDB ensures that stock is simultaneously decremented at the source and incremented at the destination, preventing any data inconsistency. All movements are logged with user and timestamp for audit purposes (NFR2.5).

### 8.4 UML Activity Diagram — Use Case 4: Create & Apply Coupon (FR6.1, FR6.6)

end note

|Customer|
:Navigate to Checkout;
:Enter coupon code;

|React Frontend|
:POST /api/coupons/validate\n{code, cartTotal, userId};

|Express API|
:Gate 1 — Code exists?;
if (Code exists?) then (no)
  :Return: "Invalid coupon code";
  |Customer|
  :View error, try again or skip;
  stop
else (yes)
endif
:Gate 2 — isActive = true?;
if (Coupon active?) then (no)
  :Return: "Coupon is inactive";
  stop
else (yes)
endif
:Gate 3 — validFrom ≤ today ≤ validUntil?;
if (Within validity dates?) then (no)
  :Return: "Coupon has expired";
  stop
else (yes)
endif
:Gate 4 — cartTotal ≥ minPurchaseAmount?;
if (Min purchase met?) then (no)
  :Return: "Minimum purchase amount not met";
  stop
else (yes)
endif
:Gate 5 — usageCount < maxUsage\n& perUser usage < perUserLimit?;
if (Usage limits OK?) then (no)
  :Return: "Coupon not available for you";
  stop
else (yes)
endif
:Calculate discountAmount\n(min of discountValue and maxDiscount);
:Return { valid: true, discountAmount, newTotal };

|React Frontend|
:Display discounted total to customer;

|Customer|
:Confirm and place order;
(order is processed — see UC2)

stop

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The swimlane diagram separates the Marketing Manager's creation flow from the Customer's redemption flow. Five sequential validation gates (FR6.6) are explicitly modelled in the Express API lane, showing that all five must pass before a discount is applied. The coupon creation and redemption are distinct sub-flows within the same diagram, keeping the full lifecycle visible.

### 8.5 UML Activity Diagram — Use Case 5: Product Search & Filtering (FR2.4–FR2.7)

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam activity {
  BackgroundColor #f0f8ff
  BorderColor #336699
}
skinparam partition {
  BorderColor #336699
  FontStyle bold
}

|Customer|
start
:Navigate to Storefront;

|React Frontend|
:GET /api/products (default view);

|Express API|
:Query all active, non-archived products;

|MongoDB|
:Return full product list;

|React Frontend|
:Display default product grid;

|Customer|
:Enter search keyword\n(e.g. "Mathematics");

|React Frontend|
:GET /api/products?search=Mathematics;

|Express API|
:Full-text search on title, author, ISBN\n(MongoDB text index);

|MongoDB|

|Express API|
if (Results found?) then (no)
  :Return empty array;
  |React Frontend|
  :Display "No products found";
  |Customer|
  :Refine search term;
  stop
else (yes)
  :Return product list;
endif

|React Frontend|
:Display results with match count;

|Customer|
:Optionally apply filters;
if (Grade filter selected?) then (yes)
  |React Frontend|
  :Add grade= param;
else (no)
endif
if (Subject filter selected?) then (yes)
  |React Frontend|
  :Add subject= param;
else (no)
endif
if (Price range selected?) then (yes)
  |React Frontend|
  :Add minPrice=, maxPrice= params;
else (no)
endif
if (Sort preference selected?) then (yes)
  |React Frontend|
  :Add sort= param\n(price_asc | price_desc | newest);
else (no)
endif

|React Frontend|
:GET /api/products?{all combined params};

|Express API|
:Apply filters + sort to MongoDB query;

|MongoDB|
:Return filtered & sorted results;

|React Frontend|
:Re-render refined product grid;

|Customer|
if (Click on a product?) then (yes)

  |React Frontend|
  fork
    :GET /api/products/:id;
  fork again
    :GET /api/reviews?product=:id;
  end fork

  |Express API|
  :Return product details + reviews;

  |React Frontend|
  :Display product detail page\n(images, price, stock status,\nratings, reviews, related products);

  |Customer|
  :Add to cart or continue browsing;
  stop
else (no)
  :Refine filters and search again;
  stop
endif

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The product search swimlane separates the customer's browsing intent from the frontend's query construction and the API/database's execution. Optional filters (Grade, Subject, Price, Sort) are shown as independent decision branches in the React Frontend lane — each adds a query parameter. The parallel fork when opening a product page reflects the simultaneous fetch of product details and reviews for performance (FR2.6).

stop

@enduml
```

**Commentary:** The 8.6 swimlane diagram provides the most complete view of the coupon lifecycle — from Marketing Manager creation through customer redemption and post-order recording. Unlike diagram 8.4, this version includes: grade/product restrictions in the creation form, per-user usage tracking, the `usageHistory` append operation, and the full audit trail stored in MongoDB. The five sequential validation gates are modelled in the Express API lane (FR6.6).

## 10. Decision Models

### 10.1 Decision Table — Coupon Validation

| Condition | Rule 1 | Rule 2 | Rule 3 | Rule 4 | Rule 5 | Rule 6 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Coupon code exists in system? | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Coupon is active? | — | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Current date within validity period? | — | — | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cart total meets minimum purchase? | — | — | — | No | Yes | Yes |
| Usage limit not exceeded & user has not used it? | — | — | — | — | No | Yes |
| **Action: Apply Discount** | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |
| **Action: Show "Invalid code" error** | ✓ | | | | | |
| **Action: Show "Coupon inactive" error** | | ✓ | | | | |
| **Action: Show "Coupon expired" error** | | | ✓ | | | |
| **Action: Show "Minimum purchase not met" error** | | | | ✓ | | |
| **Action: Show "Coupon not available" error** | | | | | ✓ | |

**Assumptions:** A dash (—) means the condition is not evaluated. Each rule processes sequentially left to right.

### 10.2 Decision Table — Inventory Stock Deduction on Order

| Condition | Rule 1 | Rule 2 | Rule 3 | Rule 4 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Customer is logged in? | Yes | Yes | No (Guest) | No (Guest) |
| All ordered items in stock at preferred location? | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| **Action: Create order & deduct stock** | **✓** | ✗ | **✓** | ✗ |
| **Action: Try alternate location stock** | | ✓ (retry) | | ✓ (retry) |
| **Action: Return "Out of Stock" error if all locations fail** | | ✓ | | ✓ |
| **Action: Save cart for registered user** | ✓ | | ✗ | |
| **Action: Send confirmation email** | ✓ | | ✓ | |

**Assumptions:** Guest orders cannot save carts. The system attempts fulfillment from the preferred location first before checking others.
