# Sprint 0 - Whole Project Perspective
## Foundation Phase for Methsara Publications Webstore

---

## 🎯 What is Sprint 0?

**Sprint 0** is the **foundation phase** that happens **before actual development begins**. It's the setup and planning sprint where you prepare everything needed for successful development sprints.

### Key Concept:
> Sprint 0 is NOT about writing code for features.  
> Sprint 0 is about **preparing the team, tools, and plan** so that Sprint 1 can start smoothly.
