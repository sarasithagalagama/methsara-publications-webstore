## 2. How the Backend / API Works

```
HTTP Request  (e.g., POST /api/products)
        │
        ▼
   server.js  ──► app.use('/api/products', productRoutes)
                              │
                              ▼
                   productRoutes.js (router)
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    │ protect + authorize │   ← JWT check + role check
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                   productController.js
                       createProduct()
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    │   Mongoose save    │   ← validates + inserts to MongoDB
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                    { success: true, data: {...} }
```

**Image Upload Flow:**
```
POST /api/upload/product-image
        │
        ▼
  uploadRoutes.js → Multer middleware
        │         (filters: only image/*, max 5MB)
        │
        ▼
  File saved to: epics/E2_ProductCatalog/uploads/
        │
        ▼
  Response: { url: '/uploads/filename.jpg' }
        │
        ▼
  That URL is stored in Product.images[]
```

## 5. Database — How It Works & Where Data Is Saved

### MongoDB Collections

#### `products` (model: `Product.js`)
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String (required),
  author: String (required),
  ISBN: String (unique),
  description: String,
  price: Number (required, min: 0),
  images: [String]        ← array of URL paths like '/uploads/abc.jpg'
  category: ObjectId (ref: Category),
  grade: String (enum: Grade 1–13, A/L, O/L, etc.),
  examType: String (enum: Local, London, Cambridge, etc.),
  publisher: String,
  language: String (enum: English, Sinhala, Tamil),
  stock: Number (min: 0),
  isFeatured: Boolean (default: false),
  isArchived: Boolean (default: false),
  viewCount: Number (default: 0),
  salesCount: Number (default: 0),
  averageRating: Number (default: 0),
  numReviews: Number (default: 0),
  reviews: [ObjectId] (ref: Review),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Soft Delete:** `isArchived: true` hides products from public browsing without removing them from the database. You can restore them later.

**Campaign Discount Overlay:** When a product is returned by the API, `Campaign.getDiscountedPrice(product)` is called. This queries the `Campaign` collection for any active campaigns that include this product's grade or category and applies the best available discount to the returned price. The original `price` in MongoDB is not modified.

#### `reviews` (model: `Review.js`)
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  product: ObjectId (ref: Product),
  user: ObjectId (ref: User),
  rating: Number (required, 1–5),
  comment: String (required),
  isVerifiedPurchase: Boolean (default: false),
  isApproved: Boolean (default: true),
  helpfulVotes: [ObjectId] (ref: User),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Verified Purchase:** When a review is created, the controller checks if the user has a completed order containing this product. If yes, `isVerifiedPurchase: true` is set, which adds a badge in the UI.

**One Per User:** A compound index `{ product: 1, user: 1 }` with `unique: true` prevents duplicate reviews.

#### `categories` (model: `Category.js`)
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String (required, unique),
  description: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Relationships:**
- `products.category` → `categories` (many-to-one)
- `products.reviews` → `reviews` (one-to-many)
- `reviews.user` → `users` (many-to-one from E1)

**File Storage:**
Product images are saved to the filesystem at:
```
epics/E2_ProductCatalog/uploads/<generated-filename>.jpg
```
The URL path stored in MongoDB is `/uploads/<filename>`. The Express server serves this folder as static files.

## 6. Validations Used

### Mongoose Schema (Product.js)
```javascript
title:  { required: [true, 'Title is required'], trim: true }
price:  { required: true, min: [0, 'Price cannot be negative'] }
ISBN:   { unique: true, sparse: true }  // sparse: allows multiple null ISBNs
grade:  { enum: ['Grade 1','Grade 2',...,'A/L','O/L'] }
examType: { enum: ['Local','London','Cambridge','Edexcel'] }
language: { enum: ['English','Sinhala','Tamil'] }
```

### Mongoose Schema (Review.js)
```javascript
rating:  { required: true, min: 1, max: 5 }
comment: { required: true, minlength: 10 }
```

### Controller-Level Validations
- **createProduct:** verifies `category` ObjectId exists in `Category` collection
- **addReview:** checks user has not already reviewed this product (compound unique index), checks verified purchase
- **deleteCategory:** queries `Product.countDocuments({ category: id })` — rejects if count > 0
- **Multer (upload):** `fileFilter` checks `mimetype.startsWith('image/')`, `limits.fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024` (5 MB max)

### Data Flow — Product Browse

```
Customer visits /products
         │
         ▼
ProductList mounts → GET /api/products?page=1&limit=12&grade=...
         │
         ▼
Server: applies filters, overlays Campaign discounts, paginates
         │
         ▼
Response: { products: [...], totalCount, totalPages }
         │
         ▼
Renders ProductCard grid
Each card shows:
  - product.price          (original)
  - product.discountedPrice (if campaign active, shown in red with strikethrough)
```

### Data Flow — Create Product (Manager)

```
Manager fills Product Form
         │
  ┌──────┴──────┐
Upload image?   No image?
  │                │
POST /api/upload/product-image
  │ (Multer saves file, returns URL)
  └──────┬──────┘
         │
POST /api/products { title, price, category, images: [url], ... }
         │
         ▼
Product saved to MongoDB → appears in public listing
```

### Data Flow — Submit Review

```
Customer views ProductDetail (after purchasing)
         │
         ▼
Review form submitted → POST /api/products/:id/reviews
         │
         ▼
Controller checks: Order.find({ user, items.product: productId, status: 'delivered' })
         │
   ┌─────┴─────┐
  Found?      Not found?
   │               │
isVerifiedPurchase: true   isVerifiedPurchase: false
   │               │
Saved to Review collection
         │
         ▼
product.averageRating + numReviews recalculated via aggregation
```

### Where Campaign Discounts Show

Campaign discount overlay runs **server-side** in `getProducts` and `getProduct`. The frontend does not need any special logic — it simply checks:
```javascript
// ProductCard.jsx
{product.discountedPrice && product.discountedPrice < product.price ? (
  <>
    <span className="line-through text-gray-400">Rs. {product.price}</span>
    <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">Rs. {product.discountedPrice}</span>
  </>
) : (
  <span>Rs. {product.price}</span>
)}
